            <h1>12 ways you can protect the environment</h1>
            <p>
              Why should we protect the environment? Well, we only have one
              Earth … so let’s do right by it!

            <h2>Consume less</h2>
            <p>
              Curbing consumption can have a huge impact on the environment. The
              three "R's"—reduce, reuse and recycle— get a lot of attention, but
              the planet could benefit from some focus on the most important and
              most underrepresented "R": refuse. When you refuse, you say "no,"
              which is not always easy. Freebies at events, cheap goods on
              clearance, the hot new children's toys or the latest gadgets that
              promise to make your life better—none of these are essential. And
              they almost always end up either in the trash or forgotten in the
              back of a closet. Next time you’re tempted to purchase or accept a
              non-essential item, think about whether it would truly improve
              your life. If not, it's ok to just say, "No, thanks!"

            <h2>Compost</h2>
            <p>
              Another “R” that doesn’t get much attention but has important
              environmental implications is “rot.” As in, let your food and yard
              waste rot naturally in the soil instead of sending it to the
              landfill. In other words: compost. Composting your food scraps and
              yard waste offers double rewards: it keeps an incredible amount of
              trash out of the waste stream, and it produces free, rich soil to
              use in your garden. Some cities now pick up organic waste
              alongside regular trash and recycling pick up. If your area
              doesn’t offer this service, no worries— you can set up a
              low-maintenance compost pile in your backyard.

            <h2>Choose reusable over single-use</h2>
            <p>
              Think about how many people you see each day drinking beverages
              from disposable cups or disposable bottles, sipping from
              disposable straws, carrying disposable grocery bags, eating from
              disposable plates or containers and using disposable utensils. All
              that single-use plastic has to go somewhere, and it’s had a
              devastating effect on our soil, oceans and marine life. All of the
              above items (and more) have more environmentally responsible
              counterparts. Switch to reusable items and make a commitment to
              use them as often as possible. You’ll have less trash piling up at
              your curb, and you’ll be helping to protect the environment in a
              major way.

            <h2>Upcycle more</h2>
            <p>
              Get creative with your useless or unwanted items by
              upcycling—basically, turning trash into treasure. Creating
              something new such as artwork, toys or jewelry is both satisfying
              and one of the best ways to protect the environment. Not only does
              it keep items out of the trash, it can prevent having to purchase
              new items, which require lots of resources to produce. Children
              love making things; so instead of heading to the craft store,
              check out your recycle bin first and let their imaginations soar!

            <h2>Recycle properly</h2>
            <p>
              If you can’t refuse it…and you can’t rot it…and you can’t reduce
              it…and you can’t upcycle or reuse it…then it’s time to turn to the
              final “R”—recycling. Educate yourself on what can and cannot be
              recycled in your bins at home. Throwing the wrong items in the
              recycle bin can result in an entire load being rejected, which
              means … back to the landfill. You can also easily find out how to
              recycle special items such as electronics, batteries and
              appliances. Check with your local municipality for drop-off sites,
              and make an effort to get your items to the proper disposal sites.

            <p>
              Did you know it takes over 2600 liters of water to grow enough
              cotton to make just one plain t-shirt? Instead of heading to the
              mall to buy new clothes, consider looking first in a thrift store
              or vintage shop, or trading clothes with friends. You can breathe
              new life into your wardrobe without wasting the precious resources
              needed to produce new clothing. Shopping secondhand also applies
              for many other categories of consumer goods: children’s games and
              toys, shoes, appliances, furniture, cars and more.
